        <h1>Basketball<</h1>
        <p>basketball, Court game between two teams of five players. They score by tossing, or “shooting,” an inflated ball through a raised
         hoop, or “basket,” located in their opponent’s end of the court. A goal is worth two points, three if shot from outside a specified
          limit. A player who is fouled (through unwarranted physical contact) by another is awarded one to three free-throw attempts (depending on the circumstances of the foul). A successful free throw is worth one point. Invented in 1891 by James A. Naismith at the YMCA Training School in Springfield, Mass., basketball
        quickly became popular throughout the U.S., with games organized at the high school and collegiate level for both sexes.</p>

        <h3>Basketball</h3>
        <p> Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which 
            require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense,
             they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound,
            that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling
            the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.The five players on each side fall into five playing 
            positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but
             more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point
              guard, who implement the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning).
               Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
            Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, 
            in the United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.
            [1][2] The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world 
            in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition[3][4] (drawing most of its talent from U.S. college
             basketball). Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the
              EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball
               Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world. 
            Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup.</p>
