        <h1>hockey</h1>
        <p>Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter
             team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such
              as in a gymnasium. While these sports vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel, 
              and playing surface, they share broad characteristics of two opposing teams using a stick
               to propel a ball or disk into a goal.</p>

         <p>Field hockey is played on gravel, natural grass, or sand-based or water-based artificial turf, with a small,
             hard ball approximately 73 mm (2.9 in) in diameter. The game is popular among both men and women in many parts 
             of the world, particularly in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina. In most countries,
              the game is played between single-sex sides, although they can be mixed-sex.The governing body is the 126-member
               International Hockey Federation (FIH). Men's field hockey has been played at each Summer Olympic Games since 1908 
               except for 1912 and 1924, while women's field hockey has been played at the Summer Olympic Games since 1980.
            Modern field hockey sticks are constructed of a composite of wood, glass fibre or carbon fibre (sometimes both) and
             are J-shaped, with a curved hook at the playing end, a flat surface on the playing side and a curved surface on the rear
              side. All sticks are right-handed â€“ left-handed sticks are not permitted.
            While field hockey in its current form appeared in mid-18th century England, primarily in schools, it was not 
            until the first half of the 19th century that it became firmly established. The first club was created in 1849 at
             Blackheath in south-east London. Field hockey is the national sport of Pakistan.[17] It was the national sport of
              India until the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports declared in August 2012 that India has no national sport. </p>
